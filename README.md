**This is a work in progress.**


The goal of this project is to check out the feautres of Firebase API as an easy backend for MVP projects.\
An app gets content from the firebase database and uses it to populate the website.  

The project is written in React + SCSS.

For now a `Home` and `Culture` categories have been implemented in their basic form. There is also `Admin` tab letting the user authenticate so he can add and manage posts.

As plans for a future I want to add a article page and maybe create a basic admin panel with more options and views.

The layout was taken from "Weekly WebDev Challenge" [group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/940002776068923/) on Facebook.
